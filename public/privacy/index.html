            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Find a Guest. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our web application.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect minimal personal information to provide and improve our services. The types of information we collect include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Anonymous Identifiers:</strong> When you use Find a Guest, we use Firebase's anonymous authentication to generate a unique identifier for your session without requiring any personal information.</li>
                <li><strong>Chat Data:</strong> We collect and store your chat messages and voice recordings temporarily to facilitate real-time communication. This data is deleted once the chat session ends.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect information on how the service is accessed and used, including information such as your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, and version.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide and maintain our service, including real-time chat functionality.</li>
                <li>To monitor the usage of our service and gather analytical data to improve user experience.</li>
                <li>To enhance the security of our service and prevent fraud or abuse.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We take the security of your data seriously and implement industry-standard practices to protect your information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SSL Encryption:</strong> We use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption to protect data transmitted between your device and our servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Database Rules:</strong> Our Firebase Realtime Database is protected by strict security rules, ensuring that only authorized access is allowed.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We minimize data collection to only what is necessary for the functioning of the service and delete data as soon as it is no longer needed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain your data only for as long as necessary to provide the service. Once a chat session ends, all chat messages and voice recordings are deleted from our servers.</p>
