        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>"Find a Guest" is an innovative web application designed to connect users with strangers for random, anonymous
            chats. The app's primary goal is to facilitate social interactions in a respectful and secure environment.
            Users can engage in text-based conversations, send voice messages, and explore various interactive features
            to enhance their chatting experience. The application utilizes Firebase for real-time database management,
            user authentication, and media storage, ensuring that the chat experience is both seamless and responsive.</p>

    <section id="features">
        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anonymous Chatting:</strong> Users can chat anonymously with strangers. This feature allows
                individuals to connect without sharing personal information, fostering a safe environment for open
                conversation.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Communication:</strong> The app uses Firebase's real-time database to manage active
                users and chat messages. Messages are instantly updated in the chat interface, providing a smooth, live
                chat experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Voice Messaging:</strong> In addition to text messages, users can send voice messages. The app
                includes options to record, listen, and send or cancel the voice message, mimicking popular messaging
                platforms like WhatsApp.</li>
            <li><strong>Message Controls:</strong> Users have control over their messages, with the ability to delete
                their messages. Deleted messages are removed from both users' chat windows. Users can also reply to
                specific messages, creating a nested conversation thread that adds context to ongoing discussions.</li>
            <li><strong>Active User Monitoring:</strong> The app keeps track of the number of active users and displays
                this count in real-time. This feature informs users about the current engagement on the platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Chat Room Management:</strong> Chat rooms are dynamically created when two users are connected.
                The app ensures that each user is matched with another random active user, enhancing the surprise element
                of the chat. If a user decides to leave the chat, a system message is sent to the remaining user,
                notifying them that the other participant has left.</li>
            <li><strong>Typing Indicator:</strong> The app includes a typing indicator that alerts users when the other
                person is typing. This feature makes the chat experience more interactive and dynamic.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The application is designed to be fully responsive, working
                seamlessly across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The UI adjusts itself
                according to the screen size, providing an optimal user experience.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="architecture">
        <h2>Technical Architecture</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Frontend:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTML5 & CSS3:</strong> The app's structure and design are built using HTML5 and CSS3,
                        ensuring a modern and responsive user interface.</li>
                    <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> The core logic for user interactions, voice message handling, and
                        chat room management is implemented using JavaScript.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Backend:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Firebase Realtime Database:</strong> This is used to store and retrieve chat messages,
                        manage active users, and handle chat room assignments in real time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> Users are authenticated anonymously via Firebase,
                        allowing them to participate in chats without requiring personal information or sign-up.</li>
                    <li><strong>Firebase Storage:</strong> Voice messages are stored securely in Firebase storage,
                        allowing users to send and receive audio clips during their chats.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Voice Message Handling:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>The app leverages the Web Audio API and MediaRecorder interface to capture and manage voice
                        recordings. Users can record their voice, listen to the playback, and decide whether to send or
                        cancel the recording. The audio data is then uploaded to Firebase storage and shared in the
                        chat.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Event Handling:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Message Sending:</strong> Messages (both text and voice) are sent in real-time, with
                        Firebase managing the backend to ensure all users in the chat room see the messages
                        simultaneously.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Disconnect:</strong> When a user leaves the chat, the app sends a notification to
                        the remaining participant and handles the closure of the chat room.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="ux">
        <h2>User Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Starting a Chat:</strong> Upon accessing the app, users are automatically signed in anonymously
                and added to the pool of active users. They can click a button to find a random user to chat with.</li>
            <li><strong>Engaging in a Chat:</strong> Once matched, users can start a text conversation, reply to specific
                messages, or send voice messages. The chat interface is designed to be intuitive, with easy-to-use
                controls for managing the conversation.</li>
            <li><strong>Voice Messaging:</strong> Users can initiate a voice message by clicking the "ðŸŽ¤" button, which
                reveals controls for recording. They can stop the recording at any time, play it back, and either send or
                cancel the message based on their preference.</li>
            <li><strong>Leaving a Chat:</strong> If a user decides to leave the chat, they can click the "Leave the
                Chat" button. The app notifies the other participant that the user has left, and the chat room is
                closed.</li>
            <li><strong>System Messages:</strong> The app uses system messages to inform users of key events, such as
                when the other participant leaves the chat. These messages are clearly differentiated from regular user
                messages.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="security">
        <h2>Security and Privacy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anonymous Authentication:</strong> The app uses Firebaseâ€™s anonymous authentication, which does
                not require users to provide any personal information. This ensures that users remain completely
                anonymous while using the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Storage:</strong> All user-generated content, including text messages and voice
                recordings, is stored securely in Firebase. The app follows best practices for data security and privacy,
                ensuring that all data is protected.</li>
            <li><strong>No Data Retention:</strong> The app is designed for transient interactions. Once a chat ends and
                the chat room is closed, the messages are removed, ensuring that conversations remain private and
                ephemeral.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="future">
        <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Reporting and Moderation:</strong> Adding a feature that allows users to report
                inappropriate behavior, ensuring that the platform remains safe and respectful.</li>
            <li><strong>Text-to-Speech Integration:</strong> Integrating a feature that converts text messages to speech,
                enhancing accessibility for users with disabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-Language Support:</strong> Expanding the app to support multiple languages, making it
                accessible to a broader global audience.</li>
            <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> Allowing users to set preferences, such as choosing a specific region
                or interest for finding a chat partner.</li>
        </ul>
